# Overview

This Password Manager is a command-line application written in Rust that securely stores, retrieves, and manages passwords for various services. It demonstrates key Rust programming concepts such as variable mutability, ownership and borrowing, conditionals, loops, and error handling. Additionally, the software incorporates a HashMap for efficient data storage and retrieval, and it includes file I/O functionality to save and load data between program sessions.

## Purpose

The purpose of writing this software is to deepen my understanding of the Rust programming language, particularly its unique concepts like ownership, borrowing, and memory safety. By building this Password Manager, I aimed to create a functional, real-world application while learning Rust's syntax, standard library, and error-handling capabilities.
